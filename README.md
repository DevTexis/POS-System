# POS-System
This HTML code provides a fun, interactive Point of Sale (POS) system, designed as a toy. It includes features like product selection, a running total, and checkout, but it's a simplified version not for real-world transactions. It's a great way for testing tech such as your scanners or if you would just like to see the functions.

Currently we have a few Different style POS Systems avaliable for you to use free of charge. 

# What will you need?

* Notepad
* Internet Browser (Chrome)
* The file of the POS you are looking for. (I.e HotelPOS.html)
