# POS-System
This HTML code provides a fun, interactive Point of Sale (POS) system, designed as a toy. It includes features like product selection, a running total, and checkout, but it's a simplified version not for real-world transactions. It's a great way for kids (or adults!) to play "shop" and learn basic retail math.
